	* Boundary => hand-made 
	*  Buidling, road (and others ...) => dowloaded from Open-StreetMap, cropped by the boundary
	* Additional attribute  for buildings (level, flats) => IGN BD TOPO (building  layer). 
		-> Buildings from BD TOPO are crossed with buildings from OSM  to assign levels and flats to the buildings extracted from the OSM
	* PLU -> parcelles  => PARCELLAIRE EXPRESS (IGN), PARCELLE layer
		-> informations : fichier PDF PLUi-H (3C1 – DGR au 2500e - cahier des planches graphiques)	

Remarque : les batiments sur PARCELLAIRE EXPRESS semblent plus précis  que sur OSM.
